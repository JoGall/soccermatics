\arguments{
\item{df}{a dataframe containing x,y-coordinates of player position and a player identifier variable}

\item{lengthPitch, widthPitch}{numeric, length and width of pitch in metres}

\item{fill1, fill2}{character, fill colour of position points of team 1, team 2 (team 2 \code{NULL} by default)}

\item{col1, col2}{character, border colour of position points of team 1, team 2 (team 2 \code{NULL} by default)}

\item{labelCol}{character, label text colour}

\item{homeTeam}{if \code{df} contains two teams, the name of the home team to be displayed on the left hand side of the pitch (i.e. attacking from left to right). If \code{NULL}, infers home team as the team of the first event in \code{df}.}

\item{flipAwayTeam}{flip x,y-coordinates of away team so attacking from right to left}

\item{label}{type of label to draw, player names (\code{name}), jersey numbers (\code{number}), or \code{none}}

\item{labelBox}{add box around label text}

\item{shortNames}{shorten player names to display last name as label}

\item{nodeSize}{numeric, size of position points}

\item{labelSize}{numeric, size of labels}

\item{arrow}{optional, adds team direction of play arrow as right (\code{'r'}) or left (\code{'l'})}

\item{theme}{draws a \code{light}, \code{dark}, \code{grey}, or \code{grass} coloured pitch}

\item{title, subtitle}{optional, adds title and subtitle to plot}

\item{source}{if \code{statsbomb}, uses StatsBomb definitions of required variable names (i.e. `location.x`, `location.y`, `player.id`, `team.name`); if \code{manual} (default), respects variable names defined in function arguments \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{id}, \code{name}, and \code{team}.}

\item{x, y, id, name, team}{names of variables containing x,y-coordinates, unique player ids, player names, and team names, respectively; \code{name} and \code{team} NULL by default}
}
