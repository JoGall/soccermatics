\title{Draw a timeline showing cumulative expected goals (xG) over the course of a match using StatsBomb data.}
\usage{
soccerxGTimeline(
  df,
  homeCol = "red",
  awayCol = "blue",
  adj = TRUE,
  labels = TRUE,
  y_buffer = 0.3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a dataframe containing StatsBomb data from one full match}

\item{homeCol, awayCol}{colours of the home and away team, respectively}

\item{adj}{adjust xG using conditional probability to account for multiple shots per possession}

\item{labels}{include scoreline and goalscorer labels for goals}

\item{y_buffer}{vertical space to add at the top of the y-axis (a quick and dirty way to ensure text annotations are not cropped).}
}
\value{
a ggplot object
}
\description{
Draw a timeline showing cumulative expected goals (xG, excluding penalties and own goals) by two teams over the course of a match, as well as plotting the scoreline and goalscorer at goal events. Currently only works with StatsBomb data but compatability with other (non-StatsBomb) shot data will be added soon.

# w/ goalscorer labels, adjusted xG data

# no goalscorer labels, raw xG data
