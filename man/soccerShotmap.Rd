\title{Draw an individual, team, or two team shotmap using StatsBomb data}
\usage{
soccerShotmap(
  df,
  lengthPitch = 105,
  widthPitch = 68,
  homeTeam = NULL,
  adj = TRUE,
  n_players = 0,
  size_lim = c(2, 15),
  title = NULL,
  subtitle = NULL,
  theme = c("light", "dark", "grey", "grass")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{dataframe containing x,y-coordinates of player passes}

\item{lengthPitch, widthPitch}{length and width of pitch, in metres}

\item{homeTeam}{if \code{df} contains two teams, the name of the home team to be displayed on the left hand side of the pitch. If \code{NULL}, infers home team as the team of the first event in \code{df}.}

\item{adj}{adjust xG using conditional probability to account for multiple shots per possession}

\item{n_players}{number of highest xG players to display}

\item{size_lim}{minimum and maximum size of points, \code{c(min, max)}}

\item{title, subtitle}{optional, adds title and subtitle to half pitch plot. Title defaults to scoreline and team identity when two teams are defined in \code{df}.}

\item{theme}{draws a \code{light}, \code{dark}, \code{grey}, or \code{grass} coloured pitch with appropriate point colours}
}
\value{
a ggplot object
}
\description{
If \code{df} contains two teams, draws a shotmap of each team at either end of a full pitch. If \code{df} contains one or more players from a single team, draws a vertical half pitch. Currently only works with StatsBomb data but compatability with other (non-StatsBomb) shot data will be added soon.
